# Schedule builder

## Main purpose
Schedule builder was built for Braude College student to make the schedule planning before every semester much easier<br />

## Course info uploading
To insert the course info (lecturers, exercises, etc) all we have to do is to download the page's HTML contains all the course<br />
info and upload it to the site, which will extract the relevant data automatically.
## Functionality
The site was designed to be comfortable and simple to use, it will find and display for us the possible schedules<br />
and will also allow us to insets out constraints for the schedule, for example, windowless schedule and free day on Thursday.

## Uploading to the net
The Web_App was uploaded to the net by Heroku
